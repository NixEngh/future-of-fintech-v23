## Task description
This is my solution to Stacc's future of fintech coding challenge.
I was quite busy this week, so I decided to do a very limited task. I have created a simple web app that allows you to log in and log out using auth0. When logged in you can see the consumption data included in the task. 
## How to run
Install dependencies with `yarn` and run the app with `yarn start`. The app will be available at `localhost:3000`.
It's also hosted on vercel: https://stracc.vercel.app/
## Comments
I chose to use the material ui component library due to it's detailed documentation. I haven't used auth0 before and thought it didn't look too complicated while also being secure. I haven't worked much with authentication so I didn't dare implement it myself.
